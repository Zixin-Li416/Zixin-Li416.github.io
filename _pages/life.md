[Weili Zhang](https://www.ufc.com/athlete/weili-zhang) is not just my favorite MMA fighter—she's a true inspiration. As the first Chinese and Asian UFC champion, she has broken barriers and redefined what's possible in the sport.

I had the incredible honor of meeting her at UFC 322 in New York City. Weili is a true warrior who understands both victory and defeat, and the deeper meaning of life itself.

A true champion is not defined by the belt around their waist, but by the unwavering spirit in their heart and the grace with which they face everything life throws at them.
