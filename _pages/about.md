👋 I’m Jessie Li (李子欣), a second year Master’s student in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics) at UC Berkeley. I’m broadly interested in AI for public health, especially how generative and statistical models can reveal how individual behaviors shape population health. My work focuses on generating realistic behavioral data and uncovering underlying mechanisms from observations—balancing individual detail, population scalability, and privacy.

I’m currently working with Prof. [Serina Chang](https://serinachang5.github.io/) on human behavior simulation with diffusion models, and previously worked with Prof. [Ivor Cribben](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cribben) on statistical brain-network analysis during my undergrad studies.
