👋 I’m Jessie Li (李子欣), a second year Master’s student in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics) at UC Berkeley, interested in AI for public health - particularly in modeling individual health and behaviors. My work focuses on generating realistic behaviors and inferring underlying mechanisms from observed data, while balancing individual detail, population scalability, and privacy.

I’m currently working with Prof. [Serina Chang](https://serinachang5.github.io/), and previously worked with Prof. [Ivor Cribben](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cribben) in fMRI during my undergrad studies.
