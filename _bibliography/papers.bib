  abstract     = {Understanding the complex host-seeking behavior of disease vectors such as mosquitoes is critical for predicting disease transmission and vector control. We introduce the Behavioral State Attention Network (BSAN), a deep learning architecture designed to model the underlying sensorimotor computations of this behavior through cross-modal attention and mixture-of-experts framework.}
