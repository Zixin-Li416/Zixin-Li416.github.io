  abstract     = {Understanding the complex host-seeking behavior of disease vectors such as mosquitoes is critical for predicting disease transmission and vector control. We introduce the Behavioral State Attention Network (BSAN), a deep learning architecture designed to model the underlying sensorimotor computations of this behavior through cross-modal attention and mixture-of-experts framework.}

  abstract     = {We examine the computational reproducibility of 235 articles published in seven prominent business statistics journals between January 2021 and July 2023. Despite clear journal policies requiring data and code sharing, only 39 articles (17%) could be fully or partially reproduced. We find that 87 (37%) articles provided real data and 121 (51%) provided code, but only 22 (9%) had fully working code. Common barriers include data unavailability, incomplete code, execution errors, and inadequate documentation. Our findings reveal substantial variation across journals, with enforcement of reproducibility policies mattering more than the policies themselves.}
